# Hello, I'm Guan Chin (GC)
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gcteh"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a career changer who is currently enrolled full-time in SCTP – Cybersecurity Professional program.

Previously, I was a skilled chemical product safety executive with 5 years of experience regularly handling organisation and affiliate requests, developing SOPs and conducting training and awareness sessions. I am a team player who can work independently to meet the organisation’s expectations with professionalism. I am also proactive with improving current procedures and systems to increase work efficiency and customer satisfaction. 

## Objective
I am currently focused on developing expertise in IT security with institute training programmes, pursuing relevant certifications, and conducting home security projects. I am eager to transition into the field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
